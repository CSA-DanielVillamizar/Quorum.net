[Quorum.net](http://Quorum.net.tk) &mdash; An open-source, live updating, voting platform.
==========

The minimum number of members of an assembly or society that must be present at any of its meetings to make the proceedings of that meeting valid. There were just about enough people present to form a quorum.

[Quorum.net](http://Quorum.net.tk) is an open-source, self-hostable, **live-updating** voting/polling platform, for both live meetings, or extended polls. 

Polls can be dynamic, meaning users can(*if allowed*) contribute options and questions themselves.


Features:

- Polls can have multiple questions.
- Anyone can edit, delete, or create additional questions, and options (if allowed by the creator), at anytime.
- Live chat on the sidebar. 
- Questions can have expiration times, and thresholds (Making sure options with too few votes don't win). 
- Easily shareable poll links.
- Image and markdown support for all questions and candidates.
- Questions can hide voter names (anonymous voting).
- Questions can be either Range, or Pointing Poker style.

## Philosophy
* KISS by design and programming. An acronym for "keep it simple, stupid" or "keep it stupid simple", is a design principle. The KISS principle states that most systems work best if they are kept simple rather than made complicated; therefore, simplicity should be a key goal in design, and unnecessary complexity should be avoided. Variations on the phrase include: "Keep it simple, silly", "keep it short and simple", "keep it simple and straightforward", "keep it small and simple", or "keep it stupid simple".

* Select the best tools for the job, use tools that take less time to finish the job.
* Productivity over complexity and avoid unnecessary complexity for elegant or beauty code.

* Computers are machines, more powerful every year, give them hard work, concentrate on being productive.
